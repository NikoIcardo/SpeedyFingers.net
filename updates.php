                    Hi there :^)! Would you like to see what's coming next to Speedy Fingers? If so, take a peek below!
                    We would love your input too! Feel free to send us an email at <a href = "mailto : speedyfingerstypingtest@gmail.com">SpeedyFingersTypingTest@gmail.com<a> to let us know what you would like
                    to see on this website.<br><br> Or, if you are interested in contributing, send us an email listing your name and what you have in mind.
                    We (by we, I mean, I the mysterious website developer who hides in the shadows) would absolutely love to hear it!<br><br> Also, if any of you are young 
                    writers looking to get your writing out, you have come to the right place. We would love to feature your rated E for Everyone (G for general audiences, in some cases PG if its got good flavor) content 
                    on our website. Curious about what that entails??? Look below at the type and read feature!

                <h3 style = 'text-align: left'>Type to Read</h3>
                <p style = 'text-align: left'>
                    Wouldn't it be fun to type and read at the same time! We already try to put interesting content in the main typing test, 
                    but you can't always make it through the whole passage before the time is up. (Congrats if you are speedy enough to do that!)
                    So, what we were thinking, is what if we had a test that let you go as long as you wanted while reading interesting stories. You could stop whenever you want, 
                    read great writing, and improve your typing as you went! Let us know if this is something you would like us to implement, and if you had writing that you want to 
                    send in to let people type. We will credit your writing so it's free advertising!
                    <br><br>
                    In line with this, 'ARE YOU A COPY WRITER?'. If you write copy, you know that one of the best ways to improve your skills is retyping successful emails and sales letters. 
                    Soon we are going to be offering a copy section that will let you both improve your typing skills and also practice your copy at the same time by retyping letters that have made 
                    millions of dollars in online sales!

                <p style = 'text-align: left'>
                    We will be working on adding further customizeability to create a pleasant typing environment! Considered features are color choices and even themes and custom images! 
                    Note that we have already added quite a bit in terms of this feature, if you would like to check it out, please view the profile page!
