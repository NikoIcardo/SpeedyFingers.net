              <p>
              Proficient English typing skills are required by almost 90% of America’s workforce? 
              <br><br>
              Having advanced English typing skills DRAMATICALLY increases your ability to land higher paying jobs?
              <br><br>
              The pandemic has made sufficient typing skills more important and more hireable than ever?
              <br><br>
              An entry level job as a receptionist or desk worker often requires you to type at least 65 words per minute before you are hired?
              <br><br>
              Legal and administrative assistants are often required to have a typing ability of at least 70 words per minute before they are hired?
              <br><br>
              It’s all true.
              <br><br>
              Typing, especially in the English language, is an ESSENTIAL skill to have if you want to land a well paying job in America.
              <br><br>
              Even the least “typing intensive” jobs usually require their employees to have a typing ability of at least 25 words per minute.
              <br><br>
              And in capitalist America, if you don’t have the typing skills, you’re not getting the job.
              <br><br>

              <br><br>
              But typing skills are not built overnight…
              <br><br>
              For most people, building proficient English typing skills can take 6 and 12 months minimum.
